### Employee Turnover Tendency Analysis
In this file, you can view the result with the presentation slides, and view the process of analysis by R code.
In addition, raw data is also included in such file.

Employee Turnover Tendency Analysis is analyzed by both JASP and RStudio. The course asked students to make an analysis by JASP, while since the result is different from the textbook and the textbook analyze the data by R, we then also try to analyze by R.
